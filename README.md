Here’s a refined and GitHub-ready **project description** for your **Student Survey Power BI** report, authored using various transformation tools like Power Query, DAX, and custom logic:

## 🎓 Student Survey Dashboard – Power BI Project

### Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes a **student survey dataset** using multiple tools—Power Query (M), DAX measures, and domain-specific logic—to uncover meaningful insights around student responses, behavior patterns, and demographic segments.

Based on publicly available examples of student survey dashboards developed using Power BI ([GitHub][1], [GitHub][2]), this report provides an interactive and visually engaging way to explore survey outcomes.

### 🛠️ Tools & Workflow

* **Power Query (M)**: Cleansed and transformed source data—handling blank values, splitting multi-choice fields, unifying response categories—and pivoting/unpivoting for proper modeling
* **DAX Measures**: Created metrics such as average rating per question, response distributions, net promoter scores, and grouped insights by demographic segments
* **Data Modeling**: Dimension tables for students (age, year, major), and survey facts with question-level responses
* **Optional**: Integrated text visuals or word‑clouds for open-ended feedback analysis

### 📊 Dashboard Pages & Visual Highlights

1. **Executive Summary**

   * High-level KPIs: average survey scores, NPS, top strengths and concerns
   * Overall response rates and demographic splits
2. **Demographic Segmentation**

   * Response comparisons by gender, year of study, major, or other segments
3. **Question-Level Insights**

   * Drill‑through visuals for individual survey items (e.g. satisfaction with faculty, infrastructure)
   * Bar/stacked charts showing positive vs negative responses
4. **Open Feedback Analysis** (if included)

   * Word cloud or bar visuals summarizing common themes in student comments

### 🎯 Use Case & Impact

This report enables educational institutions to:

* Understand student sentiment across key satisfaction areas
* Identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement
* Use drill-down analytics to segment findings by student groups
  These insights support strategic decisions in academic planning and student services.

### 📁 Repository Structure

```
/data/                 – raw survey data (CSV/Excel)  
/transformations/      – Power Query scripts (.pq or .M files)  
/model/                – schema descriptions and relationships  
/dashboard/            – .pbix file, report layout, and visuals  
/README.md             – project documentation  
```

### ✏️ README Snippet Sample

```markdown

### 🔍 Inspiration & References

This structure and approach are inspired by real-world Power BI student survey dashboards and performance analysis reports found in repositories and portfolio projects:

* **Student survey spend analysis dashboards** using Power BI with demographic and question-level insights ([DataCamp][3], [ZoomCharts][4], [mammoth.io][5], [GitHub][6])
* **Student performance dashboards** that use DAX and Power Query to uncover educational insights ([GitHub][7], [GitHub][8])

### ✅ Tips to Customize Further

* Include screenshots of your report visuals in README using Markdown image links
* Add badges (e.g. Power BI icon, GitHub repo stats) for visual appeal
* If feasible, write comments or descriptions within your Power Query and DAX logic and include them in the repo
* Share performance insights or findings extracted from your dataset to make the project narrative stronger
